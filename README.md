#Idea: 
##Pintrest-like app that gets the user's sense of taste and style and customizes a wardrobe(and in the future, possibly lifestyle) that is unique to the user. The user also gets recommendations based on what they like, and eventually creates a page with their style and account. Other users can see each others pages, and can add their style to another page. 
#MVP: 
##Use a basic API to display some clothing, give different clothing tags(based on personality and style), and lets the user select different clothing.
